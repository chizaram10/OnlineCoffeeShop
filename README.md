Online Coffee Shop

Develop a UI for a small coffee shop that takes online orders. The coffee shop app menu offers hot drinks,
food, and cold drinks (water/ cans). The selection of menu orders goes to a specific screen that shows a list of
possible hot drinks, food, or cold drink options in that section. At each drink/food screen, the user may order
one or more items from that menu e.g., they may order two coffees and one tea.
On completion of the order, the user selects the ‘check out’ option, which generates the order number and
order details. The order information should also include a name and telephone number which are stored in
the database. Also, the app should provide a history list showing all orders for the current date. As a
minimum, the list should show names and order receipts.
